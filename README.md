# Forkify Recipe App

Forkify is an interactive recipe search and management application that allows users to discover and save their favorite recipes. It enables users to search for recipes, view ingredients and instructions, adjust serving sizes, and save their favorite recipes for future reference.

The app utilizes modern JavaScript features like asynchronous programming (via the fetch API), modular design, and dynamic data rendering, offering a great opportunity to practice working with APIs and building responsive, interactive web applications. With a focus on enhancing user experience, Forkify is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, making it easy to use on the go or in the kitchen.
